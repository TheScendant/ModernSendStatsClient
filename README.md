# Modern SendStats

This project is a rewrite of the client of SendStats

## Motives

I originally wrote the SendStatsClient several years ago and while tt was well written for the time, it certainly could use improvement.
New libraries such as wrappers for d3 and features from React can greatly increase this project's efficiency and readability.

I plan to leverage React Providers, React Query and functional components as much as possible while relying on recharts to build graphs for me
instead of handrolling them in d3.
